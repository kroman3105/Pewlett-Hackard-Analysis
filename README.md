# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

As per our discussion, we have created a few more tables for review that will assist in analyzing the companies preparedness for the "silver tsunami".  We have created a table with employees eligible for retirement by title, then we took it a step further to create a summary showing the number of eligible employees by title.  In order to research if we have enough employees able to fill the roles of these retiring individuals, we then created a table showing individuals who would be eligible for a mentorship program if the company decided to implement it to prepare for this "silver tsunami".  

## Results

- There are 90,398 current employees who are at retirement age (born between 1952 and 1955)
- The most prominent position of riterement aged employees is Senior Engineer with 29,414 employees
- Only 2 Managers are at the retirement age
- There are 1,549 employees who may be eligible for a mentorship program (eligibitly limited to those born in 1965)
