# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

As per our discussion, we have created a few more tables for review that will assist in analyzing the companies preparedness for the "silver tsunami".  We have created a table with employees eligible for retirement by title, then we took it a step further to create a summary showing the number of eligible employees by title.  In order to research if we have enough employees able to fill the roles of these retiring individuals, we then created a table showing individuals who would be eligible for a mentorship program if the company decided to implement it to prepare for this "silver tsunami".  

## Results

- There are 90,398 current employees who are at retirement age (born between 1952 and 1955)
- The most prominent position of riterement aged employees is Senior Engineer with 29,414 employees
- Only 2 Managers are at the retirement age
- There are 1,549 employees who may be eligible for a mentorship program (eligibitly limited to those born in 1965)

## Summary

Based on our results, it appears we need to expect to fill somewhere around 90,000 roles once the "silver tsunami" makes its impact.  With over half of these employees coming at the Senior Level and above, we definitely have enough retirement-ready candidates who are able to mentor the next generation of employees.  There are a few additional queries that would help us continue to prepare for this "tsunami".  First, as more than half the employees who will be retiring are either Senior Engineers or Senior Staff, it would be beneficial to pull some queries on who makes up the current Engineer and Staff positions, so we can begin to identify which of those employees are ready to step up for a more senior role following the departure of their peers.  Finally, to really hone in on which departments need to begin planning for the next stages, it would be helpful to expand the retiring roles query to include a breakdown by department as well so those managers can begin to prepare.
